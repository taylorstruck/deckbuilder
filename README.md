# deckbuilder

I am creating an app that automates the process of figuring out how many and which kind of boards are needed for a deck
from just the length and width of the intended deck itself. I will originally create this using python but once I finish, I
will go back and "translate" it to javascript to start to teach myself javascript syntax.
