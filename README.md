# deckbuilder


I am creating a program that automates the process of figuring out how many and which kind of boards are needed for a deck
from just the length and width of the intended deck itself. The "master" program provided is just a quick 
rundown to ensure that I have the basis down of which length boards will be accomodated. I will start developing the program
to which will give actual lengths, and the # of boards to provide the length and width of the deck that the user wishes.

I am imagining my first issue being integrating the width and length of the deck together. Being that the length is in feet,
and the width is in inches, I must convert the inches to feet or vice-versa.
