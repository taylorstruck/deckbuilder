# deckbuilder

I will be dating each entry almost like a journal of sorts to keep track of my own progress and for anyone else following 
along that also may be a beginner learning to encourage the action of trying things. These attempts at things may fail at first but I have found that a lot of times we learn more from our mistakes than we do our successes.

I am creating an app that automates the process of figuring out how many and which kind of boards are needed for a deck
from just the length and width of the intended deck itself. I will originally create this using python but once I finish, I
will go back and "translate" it to javascript to teach myself javascript syntax. The "master" program provided is just a quick 
rundown to ensure that I have the basis down of which length boards will be accomodated. I will start developing the program
to which will give actual lengths, and the # of boards to provide the length and width of the deck that the user wishes.

I am imagining my first issue being integrating the width and length of the deck together. Being that the length is in feet,
and the width is in inches, I must convert the inches to feet or vice-versa.
