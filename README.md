# deckbuilder

I will be dating each entry almost like a journal of sorts to keep track of my own progress and for anyone else following 
along that also may be a beginner learning to encourage the action of trying things. These attempts at things may fail at first but I have found that a lot of times we learn more from our mistakes than we do our successes.

I am creating an app that automates the process of figuring out how many and which kind of boards are needed for a deck
from just the length and width of the intended deck itself. I will originally create this using python but once I finish, I
will go back and "translate" it to javascript to teach myself javascript syntax. The "master" program provided is just a quick 
rundown to ensure that I have the basis down of which length boards will be accomodated. I will start developing the program
to which will give actual lengths, and the # of boards to provide the length and width of the deck that the user wishes.

I am imagining my first issue being integrating the width and length of the deck together. Being that the length is in feet,
and the width is in inches, I must convert the inches to feet or vice-versa.

I have not got to work on this as much as I would have liked to the past few days because I have had family in town, so I have 
decided to post what I have now because I now have a lot more free time. The problem I am running into now is having the full 
measurements of the deck broken down (by max board length) so that each board will be broken into segments to output the 
specific number of deck boards needed. I am currently still learning programming from GT's David Joyner online and will
hopefully be able to iron this out soon.
